# The available challenges to do:

1. `Qubit routing problem`: Where you will learn to loop inside QuantumCircuits and change gates and its parameters, by other ones, 
 in order to  map theoretical circuits, into actual physical topologies of real hardware.

2. `XXZ Heisenber model`: Where you will study a spin system, a prototypical problem in condensed matter physics. Using VQE algorithm,
 you will find that spins can manifest different phases and behaviours even when they rest at their ground state.

3. `Quantum N-Queens solver`: Where you will study the queens problem, a paradigmatic challenge in computer science that is based on 
one of the classic games. Using QAOA algorithm, you will find solutions of an NP-problem and also to some variants.

If you are very new to Qiskit, we recommend starting with the `Intro.ipynb` of the `Qubit routing problem`, since it limits a lot 
what to code, being an easier introduction to qiskit, at the start. Watch out since at the end, it becomes quite problematic too :).
