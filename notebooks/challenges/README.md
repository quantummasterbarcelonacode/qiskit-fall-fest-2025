# The available challenges to do

1. `Qubit routing problem` (Transpilation): Where you will learn to loop inside QuantumCircuits and change gates and its parameters,
 in order to  map logical quantum circuits, into actual physical topologies of real hardware.

2. `Quantum phase recognition` (QML): You will learn to use a parameterized quantum computer for classification tasks. Furthermore,
you'll use it to identify the phase of a quantum state directly, constructing phase diagrams of complex quantum systems.

3. `Quantum N-Queens solver` (QAOA): Where you will study the queens problem, a paradigmatic challenge in computer science that is based on one of the classic games. Using QAOA algorithm, you will find solutions of an NP-problem and also to some variants.
