# Notebooks of the event

There are two subdirectories:

- `basic_intro`: where you will find reference notebooks for initialization, and help.

- `challenges`: where you will find the notebooks, for the challenges to do (public the 25th Oct)

If problems with installation, try `hello_world.ipynb` from `basic_intro`.
