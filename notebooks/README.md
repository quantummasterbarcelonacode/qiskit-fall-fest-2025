# Notebooks of the event

There are two subdirectories:

- `basic_intro`: where you will find reference notebooks for initialization, and help.

- `challenges`: where you will find the notebooks, for the challenges to do.


If problems with installation, try `Notebook0_QFFMQST.ipynb` from `basic_intro/notebooks_with_no_corrections`.
