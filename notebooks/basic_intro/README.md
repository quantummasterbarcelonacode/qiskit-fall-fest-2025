# Reference notebooks for practice or help

There are two types:

- `notebooks_with_no_corrections`: where you don't get any feedback if what you coded is correct, but they are easy to execute, and install, maybe a better first approach.

- `notebooks_with_corrections`: (called graded by IBM), where you get feedback of your answers.


If problems with installation, try `Notebook0_QFFMQST.ipynb` from `notebooks_with_no_corrections`.
