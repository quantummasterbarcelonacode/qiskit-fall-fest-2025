    "The queens puzzle is the problem of placing the maximum number of chess queens on an $N \\times N$ chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. It is often used as an example in various computational techniques. This problem does not have a unique solution, and the complexity of finding one increases exponentially with the size of $N$."

    "As you might have seen before, the solution obtained using the previous hamiltonian is usually a superposition of all possible configurations of rooks on the board. To obtain a single solution, we must break the degeneracy of the solution by unbalancing the positions in which the rooks appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest ways to do this is \"tilting\" the chess board, i.e., favoring the positioning of the rooks on one side of the board. To do this, one can add a small bias on the single-body terms of the form:\n",
    "\n",

    "- ...\n",
    "- $b_{NN}$ <- $b_{NN}$ + $N\\delta$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta$ should be small compared with the value of $b$ and $Q$, but not infinitely small. You might optimize this by comparing some solutions for different values of $\\delta$, or maybe use your creativity to break the degeneracy using different weights and method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduce the modification on the one-body terms and run again all the steps of the algorithm to find a solution of the rook puzzle. What is the accuracy for the algorithm to find the solution?\n",
