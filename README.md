# Qiskit Fall Fest 2024


## Welcome
This is the [Qiskit Fall Fest event for Master in Quantum Science and Technology](https://sites.google.com/fqa.ub.edu/qiskit-fall-fest-mqst/home). We're so exciting to have you all here.

The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from IBM Quantum. Student leaders work alongside IBM to design and plan their event, which are then run in the Fall on their local campus. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest here on Master in Quantum Science and Technology is going to be a series of challenges, starting on October 17th. Details about the hackathon and rules can be found below. The deadline for all projects is October 24th, at 2pm ET. Any projects submitted after that will NOT be judged. Good luck!
